# Assignment solutions

## Haskell assignment

Haskell solution can be found in `sim` directory. I used `stack` for
building. It is sufficient to run:

```
stack build
```

to build it and

```
stack exec solution
```

to run the main program.

The actual code, with extensive comments can be found in the `sim/Sim.hs`
file. The `sim/solution.hs` is just and app entrypoints.

The `sim/SimOld.hs` is the first and deprecated iteration and can be ignored.

Some cross-checks were performed using python (jupyter notebook); commited in
the `sim` directory.
